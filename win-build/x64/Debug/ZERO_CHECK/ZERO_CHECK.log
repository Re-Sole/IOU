  CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
    Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
    CMake.
  
    Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
    CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

  CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package):
    Policy CMP0074 is not set: find_package uses <PackageName>_ROOT variables.
    Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0074" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
    command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
  
    Environment variable PCL_ROOT is set to:
  
      C:\Program Files\PCL 1.13.1
  
    For compatibility, CMake is ignoring the variable.
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
